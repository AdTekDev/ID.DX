## W06.01  

**Scenario**: Withdrawing Cash from an ATM  
Imagine a user performing the common task of withdrawing money from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) at a local bank branch. The user knows their PIN and the desired withdrawal amount.    
  
**Analysis**:    
The **GOMS** (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection Rules) model focuses on the processes required to achieve a Goal using a specific device. This model is typically applied to tasks involving well-learned sequences and is useful for predicting performance time.  
Task: Analyze the process of successfully withdrawing $100 from an ATM.
1. Define the Goal: State the top-level goal the user is trying to achieve.
2. Identify Operators: List the simple physical or cognitive Actions the system permits the user to perform to achieve the goal (e.g., press digit, read screen, insert card).  
3. Outline the Method: Describe the sequence of subtasks and operators used to reach the main goal. (Referencing the simplified ATM hierarchy structure provided in the sources is helpful, e.g., Present Personal ID consists of Enter Card followed by Enter PIN).  
4. Define a Selection Rule: Assume there are multiple ways to enter the amount (e.g., select pre-set button vs. type custom amount). Formulate a Selection Rule that dictates which method a user who frequently withdraws $100 would choose.
  
  
**Why** is GOMS analysis particularly useful for predicting the time taken to complete routine tasks (such as using an ATM or a telephone operator task), but generally not suitable for analyzing situations where the user is engaged in "problem solving"?
