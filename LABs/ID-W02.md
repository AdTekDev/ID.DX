**Conduct a PACT analysis for the project**

   * **People:** Identify the target users (age, profession, digital skills, needs).
   * **Activities:** List the main activities/tasks users will perform.
   * **Contexts:** Describe the environment and usage scenarios (mobile, office, outdoor, online/offline).
   * **Technologies:** Specify the platforms and tools to be used (web, mobile, IoT, AR/VR, etc.).

**Research 3 similar applications**
   For each application, analyze the following:

   * **Data displayed:** What kinds of information are shown (numbers, charts, maps, lists, notifications).
   * **Display methods:**

     * Types of visualization (text, tables, charts, cards, timelines, dashboards, maps).
     * How information is structured (by screen, by module, by workflow).
   * **Interaction methods:**

     * Interaction types (tap, drag & drop, scroll, voice, gesture, filter, search).
     * Interaction level (static, semi-interactive, fully interactive/realtime).
   * **Strengths and weaknesses** in terms of data presentation and user interaction.

## HW02.01

These days, timepieces (such as clocks, wristwatches, and so on) have a variety of functions. Not only do they tell the time and date, but they can speak to you, remind you when it’s time to do something, and record your exercise habits among other things. The interface for these devices, however, shows the time in one of two basic ways: as a digital number such as 11:40 or through an analog display with two or three hands—one to represent the hour, one for the minutes, and one for the seconds.

This in-depth activity is to design an innovative timepiece. This could be in the form of a wristwatch, a mantelpiece clock, a sculpture for a garden or balcony, or any other kind of timepiece you prefer. The goal is to be inventive and exploratory by following these steps:

a)	Think about the interactive product that you are designing: What do you want it to do? Find five potential users, and ask them what they would want. Write a list of requirements for the clock, add some usability criteria and user experience criteria based on the definitions in exercise you did in Chapter 1.
b)	Look around for similar devices and seek out other sources of inspiration that you might find helpful. Make a note of any findings that are interesting, useful, or insightful.
c)	Sketch some initial designs for the timepiece. Try to develop two distinct alternatives that meet your set of requirements. (your own drawing only please!)
d)	Evaluate the two designs by using your usability criteria and by role-playing an interaction with your sketches. Involve potential users in the evaluation, if possible. Does it do what you want? Is the time or other information being displayed always clear? Design is iterative, so you may want to return to earlier elements of the process before you choose one of your alternatives.
