IV.	Activity 4
5)	Look at the storyboard in Figure 12.4. This storyboard shows Christina exploring the Acropolis in search of information about the pottery trade. In the second scene in the top row, Christina “adjusts the preferences to find information about the pottery trade in Ancient Greece.” Many interaction icons have become standardized, but there isn’t a standard one for “pottery trade.” Suggest two alternative icons to represent this and draw them on separateout the following activities to discover requirements for this product:

 
V.	Activity 5  
This activity is the first of five assignments that together go through the complete development lifecycle for an interactive product.  
The goal is to design and evaluate an interactive product for booking tickets for events such as concerts, music festivals, plays, and sporting events. Most venues and events have booking websites or apps already, and there are many ticket agencies that also provide reduced tickets and exclusive options, so there are plenty of existing products to research first. Carry out the following activities to discover requirements for this product:  

5)	Identify and capture some user requirements for this product. This could be done in a number of ways. For example, observing friends or family using ticket agents, thinking about your own experience of purchasing tickets, studying websites for booking tickets, interviewing friends and family about their experiences, and so on.
6)	Based on the information you glean about potential users, choose two different user profiles and produce one persona and one main scenario for each, capturing how the user is expected to interact with the product.
