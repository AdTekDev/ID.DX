## Ex04.01  

The aim of this in-depth activity is for you to try to elicit mental models from people. In particular, the goal is for you to understand the nature of people’s knowledge about an interactive product in terms of how to use it and how it works.
  
First, elicit your own mental model. Write down how you think contactless cards (see Figure 4.10) work—where customers place their debit or credit card over a card reader. 
Then answer the following questions:  
1)	How can banks overcome the problem of providing a secure system while making the memory load easier for people wanting to use online and mobile phone banking?   
2)	What information is sent between the card and the card reader when it is placed in front of it?  
3)	What is the maximum amount you can pay for something using a contactless card?  
4)	Why is there an upper limit?  
5)	How many times can you use a contactless card in a day?  
6)	What happens if you have two contactless cards in the same wallet/purse?  
7)	What happens when your contactless card is stolen and you report it to the bank?

Next, ask two other people the same set of questions. Now analyze your answers.   
8)	Do you get the same or different explanations?   
9)	What do the findings indicate?   
10)	How accurate are people’s mental models about the way contactless cards work?  

## Ex04.02
