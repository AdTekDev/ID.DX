Claim and assumption   
1)	What the main assumptions and claims were behind 3D TV?.  
2)	What the main assumptions and claims were behind curved TV (which was designed to be bendy so as to make the viewing experience more immersive)?  
3)	Are the assumptions similar?   
4)	Why were they problematic?

By comparing these two products (3D vs. Curved), students can see how the evolution of device lines often relies on assumptions about user needs and behavior. When those assumptions are inaccurate, even advanced technologies may fail to achieve lasting success.

## Ex.03.02 
Metaphhor  
Go to at least 10 online stores and see how the interface has been designed to enable the customer to order and pay for an item.   
1)	How many use the “add to shopping cart/basket” followed by the “checkout” metaphor?
