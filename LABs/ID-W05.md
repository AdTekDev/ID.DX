**Learning Objectives:**
*   Understand and apply the principles of interaction conceptualization.
*   Develop abstract thinking skills regarding system interaction.
*   Create conceptual models and conceptual interfaces for a real-world product.
*   Work effectively in teams to solve a design challenge.

**Product Context:**
A restaurant (could be a family restaurant, a buffet, or a large cafe) is looking to integrate robots to assist service staff. The goal is for robots to help staff focus on tasks requiring human communication and dexterity, while optimizing repetitive or physically demanding tasks.

**Potential robot tasks include (but are not limited to):**
*   Transporting food from the kitchen to tables.
*   Clearing dirty dishes from tables to the washing area.
*   Serving drinks or simple items (napkins, condiments).
*   Guiding customers to available tables.

**Part 0: Pre-computation / Research**

1.  **Research Existing Service Robots:**
    *   Before you start designing, research existing service robots currently deployed in restaurants, hotels, or other service industries.
    *   Identify at least 2-3 different models or approaches.
    *   For each robot, briefly describe:
        *   Its primary functions.
        *   How staff/customers interact with it.
        *   What you perceive as its strengths and weaknesses in terms of interaction design.
    *   This research will inform your understanding of current solutions and potential areas for improvement or differentiation.

**Part 1: Understanding the Context and Users**

1.  **Identify Primary and Secondary Users:**
    *   Who will directly interact with the robot (service staff, chefs, managers, customers)?
    *   Who will be affected by the robot's presence?
    *   List 2-3 primary user groups and briefly describe their roles.

2.  **Identify Needs and Problems:**
    *   Based on your identified user groups, list at least 3-5 needs or problems that the robot could solve for them in the restaurant context.
    *   Example: Service staff are tired from excessive walking, customers wait too long, etc.

3.  **Define Design Goals:**
    *   Based on the needs and problems, articulate 2-3 main goals for integrating the robot into the restaurant.
    *   Example: "Increase operational efficiency by X%", "Improve staff satisfaction", "Reduce customer waiting time."

**Part 2: Developing a Conceptual Model**

This is the core of the exercise. You need to think about how users will understand and interact with the robot.

1.  **Choose a Dominant Metaphor for the robot:**
    *   Will the robot be perceived as a "colleague," an "assistant," a "smart tool," a "carrier," or something else?
    *   Explain your choice of metaphor and how it influences how users will mentally model the robot.

2.  **Describe the Core Concepts of the system:**
    *   Identify the main "objects" and "actions" that users will think about when interacting with the robot.
    *   Example: If the robot is a "colleague," concepts might include "assign task," "accept task," "complete," "alert." If it's a "carrier," concepts might include "destination," "item," "load," "unload."
    *   List at least 4-5 core concepts and describe them briefly.

3.  **Define Interaction Modes:**
    *   How will humans interact with the robot?
    *   List the main interaction modes:
        *   **With staff:** Touch interface on the robot/dedicated device, voice, gestures, lights/sounds?
        *   **With customers:** Voice, lights/sounds, display screen?
    *   Briefly describe how each mode would be used for a specific task (e.g., "Staff use a touch interface to assign table delivery.").

4.  **Develop a Core Interaction Scenario:**
    *   Choose one specific robot task (e.g., transporting food from the kitchen to a table).
    *   Write a short scenario detailing how staff (and potentially customers) interact with the robot to complete that task, based on your chosen metaphor and core concepts.
    *   Example: "The chef places food on the robot, selects table X on the screen, the robot navigates, and a server receives the food from the robot and serves the customer."

---

**Part 3: Designing a Conceptual Interface**

1.  **Sketch a primary interface for service staff:**
    *   Based on your defined concepts and interaction modes, sketch (hand-drawn or using simple tools) an interface that service staff would use to control/interact with the robot.
    *   This interface could be on a robot's touchscreen, on a handheld device, or even a voice command panel.
    *   **Sketch a minimum of 3-5 key interface components** (e.g., "Call Robot" button, table list, robot status, command input area).

2.  **Explain interface elements:**
    *   Briefly explain why you designed the interface this way and how it supports the system's metaphor and core concepts.
