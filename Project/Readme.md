# Project 


**1. PROJECT GOAL**

This project is designed for students to comprehensively apply the knowledge and skills acquired in Interaction Design, User Experience (UX) Design, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Students will engage in a **human-centered design process**, from understanding requirements to ideation, design, and evaluation. The project emphasizes creating interactive products that are not only usable but also offer a quality user experience.

**2. CONTEXT AND TOPICS**

The primary challenge is to design an interface for applications that display complex, dynamic data requiring significant user attention and clear, effective data presentation.

Students must choose **one of the following topics/scenarios**:

1. **School Timetable Interface** (for school, class, and student)
2. **Stock Price Monitoring Interface**
3. **Cryptocurrency Tracking Interface**
4. **Storm Alert / Weather Warning Interface**
5. **Virtual Shop**

**3. REQUIRED DELIVERABLES**

Students must submit a final project report and present their design, covering the following sections:

**Part 1: Understanding and Discovering Requirements**

*   **PACT Analysis:** Conduct a PACT (People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies) analysis for the chosen topic to scope the problem domain.
    *   **People:** Define the target audience. Develop at least two representative **Personas**.
    *   **Activities:** Describe the main user activities and goals.
    *   **Contexts:** Analyze the physical, social, and organizational contexts of use.
    *   **Technologies:** Identify potential technologies (e.g., mobile, web, sensors).
*   **Competitive Analysis:** Research and analyze **at least three existing applications** for the chosen topic.
    *   Compare their forms, layouts, actions, and UI flows.
    *   Evaluate their strengths and weaknesses based on established design principles.
*   **Requirements Definition:** Based on the analyses, define the functional and non-functional requirements for your product.

**Part 2: Design and Prototyping**

*   **Conceptual Design:**
    *   Describe the **conceptual model** of the application.
    *   Propose relevant **interface metaphors**.
    *   Identify the primary **interaction types** (e.g., instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring, responding).
*   **Concrete Design:**
    *   **Layout Design:** Create sketches and **wireframes** for the main screens.
    *   **UI Flow Design:** Develop a user flow diagram illustrating the steps a user would take to complete a primary task (e.g., booking a course, executing a trade).
    *   **Prototyping:** Build an **interactive prototype** (low-fidelity or high-fidelity) using tools like Figma, Axure, Adobe XD, or even presentation software. Low-fidelity prototypes are especially useful in the early stages as they are quick to produce and modify.

**Part 3: Evaluation and Reporting**

*   **Expert Evaluation:** Conduct a **heuristic evaluation** on your prototype using the design principles listed below. This can be a self-evaluation or a peer evaluation.
*   **Report:** Compile a comprehensive report detailing the entire process. Justify your design decisions by explaining how they address user needs and design principles.

**4. DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW**

Your design must demonstrate an understanding and application of key design principles, including:

* **Usability goals**: effectiveness, efficiency, safety, utility, learnability, memorability, satisfaction.
* **User experience goals**: support positive emotions, reduce negative ones.
* **Nielsenâ€™s 10 Heuristic Principles**: visibility, real-world match, user control, consistency, error prevention, recognition vs. recall, flexibility, minimalist design, error recovery, help/documentation.
* **Accessibility guidelines**: inclusive design for diverse users (e.g., color contrast, text size, multimodal alerts).


**5. Evaluation and Grading (100 points)**
